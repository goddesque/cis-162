            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi my name is Claire. I am a computer science major. Lately I've been going to the gym a lot and weight training. I have a unicycle and heelys, but I haven't been able to figure them out, although I can bike and rollerblade well. Sometimes I get a little too obsessed with trying to make my life simpler, so I end up buying little gadgets I don't need. I wish I had a cat but I will wait until I live by myself to get one. Sometimes I have long and vivid dreams so I keep a dream journal.</p>
