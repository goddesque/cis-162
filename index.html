            <p>Hi my name is Claire. I am a computer science major. Lately I've been going to the gym a lot and weight training. I have a unicycle and heelys, but I haven't been able to figure them out, although I can bike and rollerblade well. Sometimes I get a little too obsessed with trying to make my life simpler, so I end up buying little gadgets I don't need. I wish I had a cat but I will wait until I live by myself to get one. Sometimes I have long and vivid dreams so I keep a dream journal.</p>
            <h2>When I have free time</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Make crafts like miniature house kits, sewing, and baking</li> 
                <li>Watch anime and read manga</li> 
                <li>Play videogames on my switch or pc</li> 
            </ol>
            <p>My favorite website is <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> because I like to look at memes.</p>
