                    <h2>Dragon Genesis 2-18-19</h2>
                    <p>
                       In the beginning there were no creatures on Earth. Then God made the first person, an old woman. Although she was old, she was immortal. God gave her a ring with a rock as the gemstone, but when she looked into it, it gave her clairvoyance to see anything she wanted to see. The second thing God gave her were dragons to raise. As the dragons grew up they learned how to fly, use magic, and transform into humans. They were almost immortal, but could be injured and die. When dragons are born they remember what heaven is like from before they are born. One day one of the dragons, who was in human boy form, asked the old woman for some responsibilities to help with. So the old woman gave the boy a task to handle and prepare the wheat in their barn. Wheat was their main food source, so it was an important task. But the boy messed up and left the wheat in the barn for too long and it started to rot. Maggots appeared in the rotten wheat. The boy was disgusted when he found the rot and maggots and was about to kill them when the old woman asked him, “You would kill one of God’s creatures?”. That made the boy hesitate and reconsider. The old woman saw this and told the boy that his new responsibility was to raise the maggots. The boy agreed and started to raise the maggots with help from the old woman. Soon after, the maggots grew and changed appearance. It became clear that these creatures were a new species of dragons. They would be known as the second dragons. The second dragons had some slight differences in appearance, but the main thing was that their skin was faintly translucent. As the boy raised the second dragons, one of the female dragons stood out for being helpful and charismatic. This dragon grew up to become the chief of the second dragons. And the boy who raised them grew up to be the chief of the first dragons. As the centuries went by God created more creatures, including humans. During this time the two dragon chiefs fell in love and the male dragon proposed to the female dragon by giving her the clairvoyant ring with the old woman's blessing. One day the dragon clans had a conflict with the human clans and gathered on a field prepared to battle. But the two dragon chiefs were arguing with each other with the old woman trying to mediate. The male dragon wanted to try to talk peace with the humans, but the female dragon believed there was no other way but to fight. Then the old woman grabbed the female dragon’s left wrist and looked deep into the ring’s stone and saw the truth. She said, “I see. You called them here to fight because you missed heaven”. What she meant was that the female dragon wanted to die on the battlefield so that their souls would return to heaven. The female dragon was embarrassed from being found out and tried to deny it. But after seeing that it was no use to lie, she fled the battlefield with the second dragon clan following their chief. The war with the humans was also canceled now that the truth was out. The male dragon felt betrayed and heartbroken, but he knew he had to be brave and be a good leader for the first dragon clan. This event started a feud between the two dragon clans. They fought each other to try to change the other clan’s ideologies. They also fought over the possession of the clairvoyant ring. Since the engagement was off, the first dragons wanted to return it to the old woman, its rightful owner. But the second dragons wanted to keep it for an advantage in battle. The feuding lasted centuries because of the ring’s advantage.

                    <h2>Time Travel Brothers 8-17-19</h2>
                    <p>
                        One day a man woke up from under an overpass. He couldn't remember who he was. After struggling for a few moments to remember something he gave up and decided that the most important thing to do right now was find someplace to live. So he eventually found an apartment to stay at. He lived there for three long years. Everyday felt bleak and empty because he was miserable about not having any memories. Then one day a woman appeared at his door. She looked strikingly similar to himself so he wondered if she was his sister. The man invited the woman inside and they got to talking. “Does your life feel empty, like you're forgetting something important?” asked the woman. “Yes, I have amnesia. But that's exactly how I feel.” replied the man. “What if I told you that you had three close brothers?” asked the woman again. “That sounds incredibly familiar, but I still can’t remember. Why can’t I remember?” said the man, with a tone of desperation. “Just calm down now, you will remember. Now one last question. How do you feel when I mention the poison feud?” questioned the woman. “I don’t know why but it makes me feel…angry? I can’t remember anything but the feelings,” said the man. The woman laughed. “The reason you feel angry is because you lost in fourth place after me. I am your third brother.” After saying this, the woman transformed into a man that looked identical to the other. “Now that you’re ready to remember I’ll take you home to the others,” said the third brother. Then he opened a portal and they went through together. They ended up at a huge mansion with hundreds of identical brothers walking around. The third and fourth brothers walked and met up with two more specific brothers. The other two brothers joined in on explanations. They explained that they are a species of time-traveling immortals. They mother and father love having a lot of sons, so they keep making more. The reason they are identical is because they are clone brothers. Within the brothers they form smaller groups, and theirs is a group of four close brothers. The mansion they live in exists between time and space. Now that the fourth brother is reminded of who he is, they explain what happened during the poison feud. One day two of the brothers had an argument and one poisoned the other. After dying once, the poisoned brother retaliated and poisoned the other back. Then the two other brothers joined in and it became a contest of who could get poisoned the least. The fourth brother ended up losing because he got poisoned and died the most times. The reason he had amnesia is because he had died too many times. So now there was the issue that the fourth brother still couldn't remember much. “Don’t worry about that,” said the second brother, “we can just send you back in time to right after the poison feud and you can catch up with the rest of us.” so then they sent the fourth brother to meet up with themselves in the past. Since they all met up a after dying a bunch of times, the four of them were still groggy and forgetful. But then some time passed and they eventually regained all their memories together. One day the fourth brother asked, “Hey remember that time we had the poison feud and you guys lost me on Earth for like three years? That sucked, haha.” The other brothers looked confused. “What do you mean you were lost? You met up with us after the feud.” said the first brother. “What do you…wait…you mean you guys never picked me up?!” yelled the fourth brother. “Well you never told us you were lost!” protested the second brother, “How were we supposed to know?” The fourth brother made a big sigh. “Oh my god. I can’t believe you assholes never picked me up,” he said incredulously. “Go do it right now,” he commanded while pointing a finger. “Why do we have to do it?” complained the third brother, while the other two nodded in agreement. “Because it already happened, DUH!” retorted the fourth brother. “Goddamnit he’s right,” said the first brother. They all knew it was an inevitable eventuality due to time loop laws. So the three of them marched off to go retrieve their lost fourth brother.
